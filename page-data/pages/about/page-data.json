My supervisor is Dr Earl Campbell, and I am collaborating with Yingkai Ouyang and Joschka Roffe.</p>\n<p>We are working on the improvement of chemistry simulations for quantum computers, and optimisation problems in quantum error correction. I am also interested in Quantum Program Synthesis, that is the automated discovery of programs, algorithms, and other artefacts useful in the programming of quantum computers. In other words, “Quantum Software Engineering”. I previously worked in this area with Professor John Clark in the Department of Computer Science.</p>\n<p>I have worked more generally on solving Software Engineering problems with AI methods such as metaheuristics and machine learning. For example, I’ve worked with commercial companies such as Craft Prospect in developing software for nanosatellite systems.</p>\n<p>My doctoral work was in program synthesis, specifically Genetic Programming (GP) and its application to existing software, now referred to as “Genetic Improvement”. I wrote some of the original papers in this area, and I was also one of the founders and chairs of Genetic Improvement, a workshop now in its fourth year. I recently co-authored a survey on GI, and am also leading a project to build a GI tool, known as Gin.</p>\n<p>I was one of the founders of gpbenchmarks.org, an attempt to progress research into GP by improving the standard of benchmarking in the field. I continue to research in Genetic Programming and am working on fundamental research questions in this area.</p>\n<p>I am a member of the Metaheuristics in the Large project, a very ambitious attempt to revolutionise research in metaheuristics led by Jerry Swan.</p>\n<p>Previously, I worked on the EPSRC-funded DAASE and SEBASE projects, which aimed to automate software engineering through heuristic search. Both projects involved multiple universities including Sheffield, York, UCL (where I was previously based), the University of Stirling, University of Birmingham, and Queen Mary University London.</p>\n<p>I was also a SICSA fellow at the University of Glasgow, where I was one of the founders and PI of the Glasgow Raspberry Pi Cloud project, a scale model of a cloud datacentre from Raspberry Pi’s and Lego, which was primarily used for teaching. This project led to the successful award of EPSRC funding for a larger project, Fruit: The Federated Raspberry Pi Micro-infrastructure Testbed.</p>\n<p>In the last few years I have also worked in a range of other areas including software traceability, Genetic Programming Theory, task allocation in robotics, JVM Memory Management, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and cloud deployment of metaheuristics.</p>\n<p>I have reviewed for many conferences and journals including: GECCO, EuroGP, EvoSET, SBST, CIMSBSE, TSE, IEEE CIM, WCCI, GPEM, DTIS, SSBSE, TEC, Natural Computing, PLDI.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/pages/about/"}}}
