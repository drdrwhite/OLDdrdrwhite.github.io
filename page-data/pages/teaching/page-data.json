We worked together on optimising chemistry simulations using quantum computing.</li>\n<li>George O O’Brien, a PhD student in CS at the University of Sheffield. We also collaborated on chemistry simulation. </li>\n<li>Profir-Petru Partachi, a PhD student working on NLP and ML for software traceability and test case generation at UCL.</li>\n<li>Daniel Blackwell, a final MEng student at UCL working on software optimisation for nanosatellite systems. </li>\n<li>Faustyna Krawiec, a Summer 2017 intern at UCL working on hyperheuristics for learning adaptive metaheuristics by exploiting problem domain knowledge. </li>\n<li>Xiangyi Yin, an undergraduate working at UCL on invariant prioritisation using mutation testing.</li>\n<li>Piotr Hosa – working on power management for the Raspberry Pi Cloud at the University of Glasgow. Piotr is a software engineer at Kyria limited.</li>\n<li>George Popa – working on the simulation of bacteria in the Unity Engine. George is now working at Black Rock in London.</li>\n<li>Wing Hang Li (until 2015) – Wing is studying for a PhD at the University of Glasgow, looking at the behaviour of “Non-Java” languages on the JVM. Wing continues his studies.</li>\n<li>Jim Walker (2015) – Jim worked on the Raspberry Pi Cloud project, including successfully running Google’s Kubernetes Orchestration Software on the Pi. See the blog. Jim is now studying for his undergrad degree at Glasgow.</li>\n<li>Justin McManus (2015) – Offloading and face recognition on a Pi-controlled robot.</li>\n<li>Hristo Stavrev (2014) – BigGP (Cloud-based GP). Hristo is now working in industry.</li>\n<li>Ross Barnie (2014) – A Monitoring System for the Raspberry Pi Cloud.</li>\n<li>George Kouzmov (2014) – Genetic Programming to evolve web services.</li>\n<li>Emilia Vulpe (2013) – Speculative Garbage Collection (EPSRC Vacation Scholarship).</li>\n<li>Richard Cziva (2013) – a Raspberry Pi Cloud Management System (Kubernetes before there was a Kubernetes).

Robbie is now doing a PhD here at Glasgow.</li>\n<li>Ilze Poca (2012) – implementing evolutionary image compression based on Roger Alsing’s work. Ilze’s project was nominated for a best project prize this year and she is now working in industry (NYC, last I heard).</li>\n<li>Harry Esslemont (2011) – investigating the impact of noise on heuristic search.</li>\n<li>Alan Millard (2010 and 2011) – genetic evolution of stochastic models. Alan is now a PhD student at the University of York. This work resulted in a paper that won the best paper prize at SSBSE 2012.</li>\n<li>Sam Ratcliffe (2010) – searching for invariants using genetic programming. This work resulted in a paper that won a best paper prize at GECCO 2011. Sam is now working in industry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"taught-classes\"><a href=\"#taught-classes\" aria-label=\"taught classes permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Taught Classes</h2>\n<p>AT UCL I gave guest lectures on the Research Seminar in Software Engineering (RSSE) course. I was also a course tutor on two related courses at UCL from 2016-2018, and supervised software development teams working with industry on Requirements Engineering and Software Architecture (GS01) and Software Abstractions and Systems Integration (GS02).</p>\n<p>I was course coordinator on the Research Readings in Computer Science (RRCS) course at the University of Glasgow from 2011–2013, and continued to teach on the course in 2014. I also gave guest lectures at Glasgow on the SE3 course on Software Engineering, the Professional Software Development course, and the Enterprise Computing course.</p>\n<p>During my time at the University of York, I lectured on heuristic search, evolutionary computation and programming. I also taught labs on various topics including Real-Time Systems, Discrete Maths, Introductory Programming and UML Modelling.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Teaching","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/pages/teaching/"}}}
